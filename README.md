# Anarchy Online

## AnarchyOnline_EP2_2560x1440.flatimage

Anarchy Online and tools running in wine, packaged for Linux in a single docker image.

The resolution on this one is 2560x1440 and probably works best when running the game in a window with borders.

Start the game with a smaller resolution to make room for running tools like clicksaver simultaneously
